		Line darkening script for vapoursynth ported from avisynth.
		
		fastLinedarken(clip, strength=48, luma_cap=191, threshold=4, thinning=0)
		
		Parameters are:
		strength (integer)  - Line darkening amount, 0-256. Default 48. Represents the _maximum_ amount
				that the luma will be reduced by, weaker lines will be reduced by
				proportionately less.
		luma_cap (integer)  - value from 0 (black) to 255 (white), used to stop the darkening
				determination from being 'blinded' by bright pixels, and to stop grey
				lines on white backgrounds being darkened. Any pixels brighter than
				luma_cap are treated as only being as bright as luma_cap. Lowering
				luma_cap tends to reduce line darkening. 255 disables capping. Default 191.
		threshold (integer) - any pixels that were going to be darkened by an amount less than
				threshold will not be touched. setting this to 0 will disable it, setting
				it to 4 (default) is recommended, since often a lot of random pixels are
				marked for very slight darkening and a threshold of about 4 should fix
				them. Note if you set threshold too high, some lines will not be darkened
		thinning (integer)  - optional line thinning amount, 0-256. Setting this to 0 will disable it,
				which is gives a _big_ speed increase. Note that thinning the lines will
				inherently darken the remaining pixels in each line a little. Default 24.
